PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net background1/SHOW_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin background1/SHOW_reg_i_2/O, cell background1/SHOW_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
