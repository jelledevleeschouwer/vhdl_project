If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net background1/SHOW_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin background1/SHOW_reg_i_2/O, cell background1/SHOW_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (ZPS7-1) PS7 block required - The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
